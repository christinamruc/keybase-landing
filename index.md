### Identity Landing for Kenneth Bingham <w@qrk.us> (a.k.a. kourier)

<img id="avatar" src="https://graph.facebook.com/748526162/picture?type=large">
Here is a boring little page just to assert some crypto identities on an
authenticated platform which happens to be [@KeybaseIO](https://www.keybase.io). 

This could enable me to trust your email signature when I only know you through
Twitter, and things like that.

The Keybase filesystem is not mature but it has a lot of promise. It is a global
namespace with public and private trees. The private tree allows any two parties
have a truly confidential exchange of data just by reading and writing in the
special folders on their computer. You can look over here for [more info about
it](https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs).

This web page is housed in the kbfs at `/keybase/public/kourier`. The content
is signed during upload and so is verifiable by running the Keybase app on your
computer, though it is not obvious in your web browser.

If you install Keybase you'll be able to passively track changes in the web
of identity with commands like `keybase follow kourier`. I do still have a few
early access invites.


- My [Keybase profile](https://keybase.io/kourier) is where the social medias
  connect

- You can send me secrets with [Pretty Good Privacy
  (PGP)](/blob/kourier-pgp-0xB69403FA957C5E46.asc) identity

  ```
  gpg --recv-keys "5489 E13F 8105 64DF 47FB  9841 B694 03FA 957C 5E46"
  ```

- You can grant privileges to my [Secure Shell (SSH)](/blob/kourier-ssh-id_rsa.pub)
  identity

  ```
  curl -s https://kourier.keybase.pub/kourier-ssh-id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
  ```
